# Stock-anomaly
Anomalies or outliers are individuals that behave in an unexpected way or feature abnormal properties. The problem of identifying these data points or patterns is referred to as outlier/anomaly detection. The significance of anomaly detection lies in actionable information that they provide in different domains such as anomalous traffic patterns in computer networks which may represent intrusion, anomalous MRI images which may indicate the presence of malignant tumours, anomalies in credit card transaction data which may indicate credit card or identity theft, or anomalies in stock markets which may indicate market manipulation.
